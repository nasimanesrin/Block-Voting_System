### Project Description
This project is a blockchain-based voting system designed to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections. It enables users to cast votes online with verified credentials, ensures data integrity using blockchain technology, and provides real-time vote tracking, fostering trust and accessibility in the voting process
### The Problem statement
Traditional voting systems often face challenges such as security vulnerabilities, voter fraud, lack of transparency, and limited accessibility for remote or disabled voters. These issues can lead to mistrust in election outcomes, decreased voter participation, and inefficiencies in vote counting and result verification.

A reliable solution is needed to address these concerns by providing a secure, transparent, and easily accessible voting platform that ensures the integrity of elections while maintaining voter anonymity and trust
